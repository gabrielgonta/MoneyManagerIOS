# üìù MoneyManagerIOS - SwiftUI iOS App

## Description

Welcome to MoneyManager - a SwiftUI iOS App for managing your finances! üéâ  
This simple yet captivating app allows you to track your revenues and expenses with a clean and visually appealing interface.

Accounts are presented as cards that display the current balance and related transactions.  
Adding transactions is simple: just select the amount, category, and type (revenue or expense). You can also delete transactions with a swipe. Additionally, there's a toggle in the profile view that lets you choose whether to delete a transaction while retaining its economic impact on the balance, or to remove it completely in case of an incorrect entry.

By tapping on a card, a histogram will be displayed, visually representing the financial status of that account.

Through the toolbar, you can access the Profile View, where the data provided during the app‚Äôs first launch can be reviewed, and you can upload a profile picture as well.
